# Traceless

Traceless is a secure messaging system that utilizes an oblivious server. An oblivious server not only is unable to determine the contents of a conversation between two users, but is also provably incapable of deducing whether two users on the service ever had a conversation with each other in the first place. This might seem impossible, but in this readme, we develop the cryptographic constructs to achieve such a lofty goal.
